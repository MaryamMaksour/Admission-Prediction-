# Admission-Prediction-

In this project I work with pyspark lybrary in python
To build a linear regression model using Pyspark ML to predict students' admission at the university. 
I used the graduate admission 2  data set from Kaggle. 
The goal is to use a Simple Linear Regression Machine Learning Algorithm from the Pyspark Machine learning library to predict the chances of getting admission.
